# QA Best Practices

## 1. Start Testing Early
Involve QA during requirement discussions to identify risks, gaps, and edge cases before development begins.

## 2. Focus on Risk-Based Testing
Prioritize testing based on business impact, user frequency, and technical complexity to maximize coverage with available time.

## 3. Test from the User Perspective
Validate workflows the way real users interact with the product, not just individual features.

## 4. Maintain Clear and Concise Test Documentation
Well-structured test cases and bug reports improve collaboration and reduce misunderstandings.

## 5. Combine Structured and Exploratory Testing
Use predefined scenarios for coverage and exploratory testing to uncover unexpected issues.

## 6. Validate Edge Cases and Error Handling
Testing should include boundary values, negative paths, and unexpected user behavior.

## 7. Communicate Early and Often
Share risks, blockers, and quality insights proactively with product and engineering teams.

## 8. Automate Where It Adds Value
Focus automation on stable, repeatable, and high-impact areas such as regression and critical flows.

## 9. Ensure Test Environment Stability
Reliable environments prevent false failures and increase confidence in results.

## 10. Learn from Production Issues
Use incidents and defects to improve test coverage and prevent regressions.

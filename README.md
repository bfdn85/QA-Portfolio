# QA Portfolio

## About This Repository
This repository contains sample QA artifacts that demonstrate my approach to software quality, including test planning, risk analysis, test strategy, backend validation, and defect reporting across the software development lifecycle.

## About Me

I’m a Quality Assurance Engineer with 7+ years of experience working across SaaS, financial, and regulated environments. My focus is on delivering reliable user experiences through thoughtful test strategy, risk-based testing, and clear communication with cross-functional teams.

I enjoy collaborating closely with product and engineering to identify risks early, improve processes, and ensure quality is built into every stage of the development lifecycle.


This repository showcases examples of how I approach quality, including test planning, test case design, and defect documentation.

## My approach to QA

I focus on risk-based testing, clear communication, and ensuring the user experience is reliable and intuitive. I believe quality is a shared responsibility and works best when QA collaborates closely with product and engineering teams.
